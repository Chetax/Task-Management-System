# Task Management System

A comprehensive task management system designed to streamline workflow and enhance productivity. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js), this application is a powerful tool for managing tasks, projects, and teams.

## Features

### User Authentication

* User registration and login using JWT.
* OAuth for social logins (e.g., Google, Facebook).

### User Profiles

* CRUD operations for user profiles.
* Profile pictures upload using Multer.

### Task Boards

* Create, read, update, and delete task boards.
* Add lists and cards to boards.

### Real-time Updates

* Implement real-time updates using WebSockets (Socket.io) for tasks.

### Drag and Drop

* Use a library like `react-beautiful-dnd` for drag and drop functionality.

### Notifications

* Real-time notifications for task updates and mentions.

### Comments and Attachments

* Add comments and attachments to tasks.
* File handling and uploads.

### Search and Filter

* Implement search and filter functionality for tasks and boards.

### Access Control

* Role-based access control (admin, member, guest).

### Responsive Design

* Ensure the application is mobile-friendly and responsive using CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Material-UI.

### Testing

* Write unit and integration tests for critical parts of the application.

### Deployment

* Deploy the application on Heroku or AWS.
* Use environment variables to manage configurations.

### Documentation

* Create API documentation using Swagger.

### Features To Planed In Future

* Use natural language processing (NLP) to analyze task descriptions and suggest relevant tags and categories.
* Task prioritization using machine learning algorithms to optimize task completion.
* Automated task assignment based on user skills and availability.
* Predictive analytics to forecast task completion times and resource allocation.
* Sentiment analysis to track user sentiment and identify areas for improvement.
